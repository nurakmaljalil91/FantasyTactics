/**
 * @class Texture
 * @brief Represents a texture in the game.
 * @details The Texture class is responsible for loading, binding, and managing textures in OpenGL.
 *          It provides methods to load textures from files, bind and unbind textures, and manage
 *          texture parameters. The class is designed to be used in a graphics rendering context where
 *          OpenGL is used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It can be integrated with other components such as
 *          shaders and renderers to create a complete rendering pipeline.
 *          The class uses the stb_image library for image loading and GLAD for OpenGL function loading.
 *          It is designed to be efficient and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly integrate
