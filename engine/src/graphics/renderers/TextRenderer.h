/**
 * @file    TextRenderer.h
 * @brief   Header file for the TextRenderer class.
 * @details This file defines the TextRenderer class which is responsible for rendering text in OpenGL.
 *          It provides methods to load fonts, render text with specified positions and colors,
 *          and manage text rendering resources. The class uses FreeType for font loading and rendering,
 *          and it is designed to be used in a graphics rendering context where OpenGL is used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
 *          The TextRenderer class is intended to be used in applications that require text rendering capabilities,
 *          such as games, graphical user interfaces, and other applications that need to display text on the screen.
 *          It provides a simple interface for rendering text with various styles and sizes, and
 *          it manages the necessary resources for efficient text rendering.
 *          The class is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as support for
 *          additional font formats, text styles, and rendering techniques.
 *          The TextRenderer class is part of a larger graphics rendering framework and is intended to be
 *          used in conjunction with other components such as ShaderProgram, Texture2D, and Mesh classes for rendering text in a scene.
 *          The class is designed to be used in a game engine or graphics application that uses OpenGL for rendering.
 *          The text can be rendered in various
